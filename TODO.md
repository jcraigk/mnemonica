# TODO

* Recovery
  * Insert correct grammar as each word is typed (extract from encoder)

MAYBE
* Eliminate base words across parts of speech
* Zeitwerk?
* Utilize personal knowledge by providing targeted lexicons: musicians, sports figures, then provide a bitmask for this along with version_slug so lead would be "In Miami at the Pier I saw" with Pier referring to specific set of lexicons to be used OR just entirely different place.
