# TODO

* Encoder should also provide list of raw words
* Generate could produce list in 3-4 columns
* Bug: `bin/storykey new 512` - seems to get into deep loops and produce `a bad Neo arm Neo`

* Try to use these words: https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0039/english.txt

* Recovery
  * Insert correct grammar as each word is typed (extract from encoder)

MAYBE
* Eliminate base words across parts of speech
* Zeitwerk?
* Utilize personal knowledge by providing targeted lexicons: musicians, sports figures, then provide a bitmask for this along with version_slug so lead would be "In Miami at the Pier I saw" with Pier referring to specific set of lexicons to be used OR just entirely different place.
