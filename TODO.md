# TODO / IDEAS

* Eliminate repetition by removing words from the lexicon as the string is encoded. Would need to adjust for this when decoding (increment by the number of word types preceding current word to get actual decimal value).
* Rhythmic patterns?
* Expand formats to include base64, etc
* Lexicon validator: ensure uniqueness, and hash it with a verify method
* If the last phrase consists of a single word, make it a noun
* Utilize personal knowledge by giving a questionnaire to user: musicians, sports figures, etc to adjust lexicons, then provide a bitmask for this along with version_slus so lead would be "In Miami at the Pier I saw" with Pier referring to specific set of lexicons to be used
